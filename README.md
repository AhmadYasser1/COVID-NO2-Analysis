# Nitrogen Dioxide Levels during Covid-19 Lockdown in Cairo, Egypt and Lisbon, Portugal

## Introduction
The Coronavirus disease, known as Covid-19, has brought unprecedented changes to the world, including the implementation of lockdown measures to help contain the spread of the virus. While the pandemic has had many negative effects, one potential positive outcome is the reduction of air pollution caused by human activities, such as transportation and industrial production. This Jupyter notebook aims to analyze the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels in Cairo, Egypt and Lisbon, Portugal.

## Nitrogen Dioxide
NO2 is a harmful chemical compound that can cause respiratory issues and chronic lung disease. Elevated levels of NO2 can increase a person's vulnerability to respiratory infections and asthma. The dataset, which will be thoroughly explained in the coming sections, suggests that the Covid-19 lockdown is responsible for decreasing the NO2 levels, which could lead to improved air quality and potentially reduce the risk of respiratory infections.

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis Testing is conducted on the research question that applies to Cairo's and Lisbon's respective datasets. Both the Jupyter Notebook and the Report explain why both Cairo and Lisbon were chosen as the entities to perform the hypothesis tests on.

## Data Sources
The data used in this analysis was obtained from public sources, including Our World in Data's Coronavirus Pandemic dataset, which provides daily updates on the confirmed cases, deaths, and testing rates of Covid-19 worldwide. The NO2 levels data were obtained from satellite measurements provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC).

## Usage
To run this Jupyter notebook, you will need to have the following Python packages installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy. To install these packages, you can run the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

    Copy
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
 
 After installing the required packages, you can open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells in order.

# Conclusion
The analysis presented in this Jupyter notebook aims to investigate the relationship between the Covid-19 lockdown and NO2 levels in Cairo, Egypt and Lisbon, Portugal. By merging the Cairo dataset with another dataset from a country with strict Covid-19 lockdown measures, we aim to enhance the data and analysis and confirm the relationship between Covid-19 lockdown and NO2 levels. The results of this analysis could provide valuable insights into the impact of human activities on air quality and the potential benefits of implementing measures to improve air quality.
